do proclaim that sovereign power resides with the people and do firmly establish this 
Constitution. Government is a sacred trust of the people, the authority for which is derived 
from the people, the powers of which are exercised by the representatives of the people, and the 
benefits of which are enjoyed by the people. This is a universal principle of mankind upon which 
this Constitution is founded. We reject and revoke all constitutions, laws, ordinances, and 
rescripts in conflict herewith.

   We believe that no nation is responsible to itself alone, but that laws of political morality 
are universal; and that obedience to such laws is incumbent upon all nations who would sustain 
their own sovereignty and justify their sovereign relationship with other nations.
   We, the Japanese people, pledge our national honor to accomplish these high ideals and 
purposes with all our resources.
